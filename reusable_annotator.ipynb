            " Trump said in 2015 that the medical deferment was due to a bone spur in a foot but he could not remember which foot was afflicted; his presidential campaign stated that he had minor bone spurs in both heels and that they were expected to be temporary.\n",
            " In 1972, he was reclassified 4-F, which permanently disqualified him from service.\n",
            " In the December 1969 draft lottery, Trump's birthday, June 14, received a high number that would have given him a low probability of being called up.\n",

            " In spite of his German ancestry, Fred claimed to be Swedish amid the anti-German sentiment sparked by World War II; Trump repeated this claim, including in his book The Art of the Deal, until the 1990s.\n",
            " Trump's mother Mary Anne MacLeod was born in Tong, Lewis, Scotland, to a Gaelic-speaking family.\n",

            " Bornstein noted that Trump had an appendectomy at age 10, but did not mention the bone spurs that Trump said caused his medical deferment from the military at age 22.\n",
            " A follow-up letter by Bornstein in September 2016 showed Trump's blood pressure, liver and thyroid functions to be in normal ranges, and that he takes a statin to control cholesterol.\n",
            "In May 2018, Bornstein said Trump himself had dictated the contents of the December 2015 letter, and that three Trump representatives, including longtime bodyguard Keith Schiller, had taken away his medical records in February 2017.\n",
            "\n",
            "In January 2018, Trump was examined by White House physician Ronny Jackson, who said he was in excellent health and that his cardiac assessment revealed no medical issues, although his weight and cholesterol level were higher than recommended.\n",
            " Several outside cardiologists commented that Trump's weight, lifestyle, and LDL cholesterol level ought to have raised serious concerns about his cardiac health.\n",
            " In February 2019, after a new examination, White House physician Sean Conley said Trump was in \"very good health overall\", although he was clinically obese.\n",

            " During the three years since Trump announced his presidential run in 2015, Forbes estimated his net worth declined 31% and his ranking fell 138 spots.\n",
            " When he filed mandatory financial disclosure forms with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) in July 2015, Trump claimed a net worth of about $10 billion; however FEC figures cannot corroborate this estimate because they only show each of his largest buildings as being worth over $50 million, yielding total assets worth more than $1.4 billion and debt over $265 million.\n",
            " Trump reported hundreds of millions of dollars of yearly income from 2014 to 2018.\n",

            "Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the Forbes 400 rankings of 1982, 1983, and 1984.\n",

            "Trump has often said he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father, and that he had to pay it back with interest.\n",

            " According to the report, Trump and his family committed tax fraud, which a lawyer for Trump denied; the tax department of New York says it is \"vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation\" into it.\n",

            " When the remodeling was finished, the hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel.\n",
            " The same year, Trump obtained the rights to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 664-foot-high (202 m) mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.\n",

              " Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016.  ,\n",
              " The closure of the federal investigation into the matter was announced in July 2019, but days later the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the hush payments and in August subpoenaed eight years of tax returns for Trump and the Trump Organization.  ,\n",
              " In January 2017, American intelligence agencies—,\n",
              " the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence—jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.  ,\n",
              " In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that \"the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.,\n",
              " That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.,\n",

              " The connections between Trump associates and Russia have been widely reported by the press.  ,\n",
              " One of Trump's campaign managers, Paul Manafort, had worked for several years to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych win the Ukrainian presidency.  ,\n",
              " Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, have been connected to Russian officials.  ,\n",
              " Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump. ,\n",
              " Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.  ,\n",
              " On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that had been imposed the same day; Trump later fired Flynn for falsely claiming he had not discussed the sanctions.  ,\n",
              " The Washington Post reported that Trump told Sergei Lavrov and Sergey Kislyak in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.  ,\n",
              " On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, to serve as special counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) investigating \"any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\", taking over the existing FBI investigation into the matter.  ,\n",
              " The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice, and possible campaign ties to other national governments.  ,\n",
              " Trump repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and the Russian government.  ,\n",
              " Mueller also investigated the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.  ,\n",
              " According to press reports, Trump sought to fire Mueller on several occasions—in June 2017, December 2017, and April 2018—but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.  ,\n",
              " He tried repeatedly to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to withdraw his recusal regarding Russia matters, believing Sessions would then put an end to the special counsel investigation.  ,\n",
              " On March 22, 2019, the special counsel concluded his investigation and gave his report to Attorney General William Barr.  ,\n",
              " On March 24, Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress summarizing what he said were the \"principal conclusions\" in the report.,\n",
              " He said the report did not conclude that the President committed any crimes, although it did not exonerate him for obstruction of justice.  ,\n",
              " Barr wrote on March 24 that given his authority to decide whether Trump had committed a crime, he and Rosenstein felt there was insufficient evidence to establish obstruction by Trump.  ,\n",
              " Trump interpreted Mueller's report a \"complete exoneration\", a phrase he repeated multiple times in the ensuing weeks.  ,\n",
              " Mueller privately complained to Barr on March 27 that his summary did not accurately reflect what the report said and there was now \"public confusion\".  ,\n",
              " Some legal analysts said Barr's description of the report's contents was misleading.  ,\n",
              " A redacted version of the final Mueller Report was released to the public on April 18, 2019, with the first volume finding that Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's.  ,\n",
              " Despite \"numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", the prevailing evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.  ,\n",
              " The evidence was incomplete due to encrypted, deleted, or unsaved communications as well as false, incomplete, or declined testimony.  ,\n",
              " The second volume of the Mueller Report dealt with possible obstruction of justice by Trump.  ,\n",
              " The report did not exonerate him of obstruction, saying investigators were not confident of his innocence after examining his intent and actions.  ,\n",
              " Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\", as they could not indict a sitting president per an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion, and would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.  ,\n",
              " The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\".  ,\n",
              " On August 21, 2018, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted on eight felony counts of false tax filing and bank fraud.  ,\n",
              " Trump said he felt very badly for Manafort and praised him for resisting the pressure to make a deal with prosecutors, saying \"Such respect for a brave man!\",\n",
              " According to Giuliani, Trump had sought advice about pardoning Manafort but was counseled against it.  ,\n",
              " In September Manafort faced a second trial on multiple charges, but reached a plea bargain under which he pleaded guilty to conspiracy and witness tampering and agreed to cooperate fully with investigators.  ,\n",
              " In November, Mueller's office said in a court filing that Manafort had repeatedly lied to investigators, thus violating the terms of the plea agreement.  ,\n",
              " It was also revealed that Manafort, through his attorney, had been briefing White House attorneys about his interactions with the special counsel's office.  ,\n",
              " Trump publicly hinted that he might pardon Manafort, but the incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee warned that \"dangling a pardon in front of Manafort\" could lead to charges of obstruction of justice.  ,\n",
              " On November 29, Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.,\n",
              " Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump, who was identified as \"Individual-1\" in the court documents.  ,\n",
              " The five Trump associates who have pleaded guilty or have been convicted in Mueller's investigation or related cases include Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen.  ,\n",
              " On January 25, 2019, Trump adviser Roger Stone was arrested at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and indicted on seven criminal charges.  ,\n",
              " In March 2019 the House Judiciary Committee launched a broad investigation of Trump for possible obstruction of justice, corruption, and abuse of power.  ,\n",
              " Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler sent letters demanding documents to 81 individuals and organizations associated with Trump's presidency, business, and private life, saying it's \"very clear that the president obstructed justice.,\n",
              " \",\n",
              " Three other committee chairmen wrote the White House and State Department requesting details of Trump's communications with Putin, including any efforts to conceal the content of those communications.  ,\n",
              " The White House refused to comply with that request, asserting that presidential communications with foreign leaders are protected and confidential.  ,\n",
              " According to Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, there is \"enormous\" evidence of the Trump campaign's involvement with Russia.,\n",
              " Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said there is \"direct evidence\" of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  ,\n",
              " During much of Trump's presidency, Democrats were divided on the question of impeachment.  ,\n",
              " Less than 20 Representatives in the House supported impeachment by January 2019, but this number grew after the Mueller Report was released in April and after special counsel Robert Mueller testified in July, up to around 140 Representatives before the Trump–Ukraine controversy began.  ,\n",
              " In September 2019, following a revelation that Trump had asked the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the start of a formal impeachment inquiry.  ,\n",
              " According to the testimony of multiple White House officials, the events were apart of a broader pressure campaign to further Trump's \"personal interests\" by abusing the power of the presidency.  ,\n",
              " The Trump administration released a non-verbatim transcript of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky, confirming that after Zelensky discussed the possibility of buying American anti-tank missiles to defend Ukraine, Trump instead asked for a favor, suggesting an investigation of the company Crowdstrike, in an apparent continuation of Trump's efforts to undermine the finding that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee server in the 2016 elections.  ,\n",
              " Trump then asked Zelensky to look into investigating the Bidens, and to discuss these matters with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.  ,\n",
              " Despite Trump's allegations, as of September 2019, there has been no evidence produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.  ,\n",
              " The impeachment inquiry came in the wake of a whistleblower complaint, later revealed to be about the abuse of power in the Trump–Zelensky call and other allegations: that the White House attempted to \"lock down\" the call records in a cover-up, and that the call was part of a wider pressure campaign by Giuliani and the Trump administration to urge Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.,\n",
              " The whistleblower further alleged that that the pressure campaign may have included Trump cancelling Vice President Mike Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip, and Trump withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019.  ,\n",
              " Trump confirmed that he had indeed temporarily withheld military aid from Ukraine, while offering contradicting reasons for his decision.  ,\n",
              " After the revelation, members of Congress largely divided along party lines, with Democrats generally in favor of impeachment proceedings and Republicans defending the President.  ,\n",
              " Within days, Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker resigned and three House committees issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to schedule depositions for Volker and four other State Department employees, and to compel the release of documents.  ,\n",
              " A subpoena was also issued to Giuliani for production of documents.  ,\n",
